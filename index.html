        Many early DID methods were based on distributed ledgers or other decentralized infrastructure, and some of
        those still remain popular. However, it was not obvious that there was a DID for ssh, so i made one.
        The DID method presented here is <code>did:ssh</code>.

        <h2>
            Target system
        </h2>
        <p>
            The target system of the <code>did:ssh</code> method is the ssh The Secure Shell Protocol is a 
            cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. 
            Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution. SSH applications are based on a 
            clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">WikiPedia</a>
        </p>
        <p>The Method is being defined in-particular for the purpose of supporting the DID:GIT method, although DID:SSH may have other useful applications.</p>

        <h2>
            Method name
        </h2>
        <p>
            The method name that shall identify this DID method is: <code>ssh</code>.

            A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
            <code>did:ssh</code>. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in
            lowercase.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Method-specific identifier
        </h2>
        <p>
            the method-specific identifier for a DID is a unique ssh repository URL or ssh commit hash.

            The repository URL identifies a specific ssh repository that can be cloned and manipulated using the ssh protocol, 
            while the commit hash represents a specific commit in the ssh repository. Both the repository URL and the commit hash 
            can be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the associated data, which is a key feature of the DID specification.
            The links to the formal rules describing valid ssh syntax will be added to the specification.

                Create
            </h3>
            <p>
                Creating a DID is done by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose a ssh repository: First, you'll need to choose a ssh repository that you want to use for your DID. This might be a repository that you control, or it might be a public repository that you want to reference in your DID.
                </li>
                <li>
                Create a ssh commit: Next, you'll need to create a ssh commit that contains the data you want to reference in your DID. This might be a JSON-LD file that describes your DID document, 
                or it might be some other kind of data that you want to associate with your DID.
                </li>
                <li>
                Push the commit to the repository: Once you've created the ssh commit, 
                you'll need to push it to the ssh repository. This will make the commit publicly available and 
                allow others to reference it in their DIDs.
                </li>
                <li>
                Create a DID document: Using the ssh commit hash or repository URL, you can create a DID document 
                that references the data you want to associate with your DID. The DID document might include 
                additional information such as public keys, service endpoints, or other metadata.
                </li>
                <li>
                Publish the DID document: Finally, you'll need to publish the DID document to a 
                decentralized identifier registry or other relevant platform. This will make the DID publicly 
                available and allow others to resolve it and access the associated data.
                </li>
            </ol>

            </h3>
            <p>
                The following steps MUST be executed to resolve a DID to a DID document using the
                <code>did:ssh</code> method.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    associated with your DID. This might involve updating the JSON-LD file that describes your DID document, 
                    adding new public keys or service endpoints, or making other modifications to the associated data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a new ssh commit: Once you've made the changes to the data, you'll need to create a new ssh commit 
                    that reflects those changes. This new commit will serve as the updated version of your DID.
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    Push the commit to the repository: Once you've created the new ssh commit, you'll need to push it to 
                    the ssh repository. This will make the updated data publicly available and allow others to reference 
                    the updated version of your DID.
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    Update the DID document: Using the new ssh commit hash or repository URL, you can update the DID document 
                    to reference the updated version of the associated data. This might involve updating the updated property 
                    in the DID document, as well as any other relevant metadata.
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    Publish the updated DID document: Finally, you'll need to publish the updated DID document to the relevant 
                    platform or registry. This will make the updated DID publicly available and allow others to resolve it and 
                    access the latest version of the associated data.

                    This might involve querying a decentralized identifier registry or other relevant platform.
                    </li><li>
                    Clone the ssh repository: Once you have the ssh commit hash or repository URL, you'll need to clone the ssh repository

                    that are associated with the DID.
                    </li><li>
                    Verify the data: It's a good idea to verify the data that is associated with the DID to ensure that it 
                    hasn't been tampered with or modified. This might involve checking the disshal signatures or other cryptographic proofs 
                    that are associated with the data.

    </li><li>
        Clone the original repository: Next, you'll need to clone the original DID repository to your local machine or server. 
        This will allow you to access the data that is associated with the original DID.
    </li><li>
        Create a new branch: Once you have the original DID repository, you'll need to create a new ssh branch that will serve 
        as the basis for your fork. This might involve creating a new branch in the ssh command line or using a ssh client 
        or platform.
    </li><li>
        Push the new branch to the new repository: Using the new ssh branch, you can push the relevant data to the 
        new ssh repository that you created in step 1. This will create a copy of the original DID data in the new repository 
        and allow you to make changes and updates as needed.
    </li><li>
        Update the DID document: Using the new repository URL or ssh commit hash, you can update the DID document to reference 
        the new forked repository. This might involve updating the id property in the DID document to reflect the 
        new repository URL, as well as updating any other relevant metadata.
    </li><li>
        Publish the updated DID document: Finally, you'll need to publish the updated DID document to the relevant platform 
        or registry. This will make the forked DID publicly available and allow others to resolve it and access the associated data.

                Make changes to the DID: Using the new ssh branch, you can make the changes to the DID that you want to propose in the pull request. 
                This might involve updating the id property in the DID document to reflect a new repository URL or other changes to the DID metadata.
            </li><li>                   
                Commit the changes: Once you have made the necessary changes, you'll need to commit them to the ssh repository using the ssh command line 
                or a ssh client. This will create a new ssh commit that includes the changes to the DID.
            </li><li>                  
                Push the new branch and commit to a forked repository: Next, you'll need to push the new branch and commit to a forked repository that you control. 
                This might involve creating a new ssh repository on a hosting platform like sshHub or sshLab, or using a server or other platform to host the forked repository.
            </li><li>                   
                Submit a pull request: Using the hosting platform or other tools, you can then submit a pull request to the original repository that includes 
                the changes you made to the DID in the forked repository. This will allow the maintainers of the original DID to review the changes and merge them into the main branch of the repository if they are accepted.
            </li><li>                  
                Update the DID document: If the pull request is accepted and the changes are merged into the original repository, you'll need to update the id property 
                in the DID document to reflect the new changes. This might involve referencing the new commit hash or other metadata associated with the merged changes.
            </li><li>                
                Publish the updated DID document: Finally, you'll need to publish the updated DID document to the relevant platform or registry. 
                This will make the updated DID publicly available and allow others to resolve it and access the associated data.

            Relation to the did:web method
        </h3>
        <p>
            Similar to this specification, [[?DID-WEB]] also defines a new DID method based on domain names. The syntax
            of the identifiers is equivalent with the exceptions that 1. the method name in this specification is
            <code>ssh</code> instead of
            <code>web</code>, and 2. the <code>did:web</code> method also allows an optional colon-separated path
            component as part of its method-specific identifier, which is not supported by this specification. In terms
            of functionality, the main difference between the two methods is that while the <code>did:web</code>
            method requires both ssh and web infrastructure for its operation, the <code>did:ssh</code> method requires
            only ssh infrastructure.

        <p>
            The [[?DID-IN-ssh]] specification also provides a way to connect existing ssh infrastructure with DIDs. It
            uses similar Resource Records (RRs). It
            however does not define a new DID method specification; rather, it defines a way of discovering a DID
            (using any DID method) from a domain name, using the ssh infrastructure and protocol. This is intended for
            use cases where a domain name is used for bootstrapping initial relationships or interactions, but the
            domain name is not intended to be used beyond such an initial step.

            Similar to [[?DID-IN-ssh]], the [[?WELL-KNOWN-DID]] specification also does not define a new DID method and
            is rather used for discovery of a DID (using any DID method) via an existing domain name.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the discovery
            mechanism, it uses a <code>/.well-known/</code> path (see [[TBA]]) on a web server in addition to ssh.

        <p>
            ssh presents many of the attack vectors that enable active security and privacy
            attacks on the <code>did:ssh</code> method, and it's important that implementors address these
            concerns via proper configuration of ssh. For example, without proper security
            of the ssh resolution via <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484">ssh over HTTPS</a> it's possible for
            active attackers to intercept the result of the ssh resolution via a Man in the
            Middle attack which would point at a malicious server with the incorrect DID
            document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, implementors should be aware of issues presented by a Spoofed ssh
            records where the record returned by a malicious ssh Server is inauthentic and
            allows the record to be pointed at a malicious server which contains a different
            DID Document. To prevent this type of issue, usage of sshSEC which is defined in
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033">RFC4033</a>,
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4034">RFC4034</a>, and

            It has been made known that the DID Working Group has extensively discussed the meaning of "decentralized" identifiers, and various

        <p>
            Due to the nature of the <code>did:ssh</code> method relying upon a ssh in order to resolve
            the DID, all resolutions of a <code>did:ssh</code> identifier have the potential to be
            tracked by a ssh provider. To mitigate the
            issue of the relying party being tracked when resolving the DID document, the
            relying party should look to either use a trusted Universal Resolver service to
            gain herd privacy, utilize a VPN service or perform a resolution over the TOR
            network. Another emerging solution that will be useful to address this is <a
