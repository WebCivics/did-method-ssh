        Many early DID methods were based on distributed ledgers or other decentralized infrastructure, and some of
        those still remain popular. However, it was not obvious that there was a DID for GIT, so i made one.
        The DID method presented here is <code>did:git</code>.

        <h2>
            Target system
        </h2>
        <p>
            The target system of the <code>did:git</code> method is the GIT distributed version control system, originally 
            authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel. The source code for Git refers to the program as, 
            "the information manager from hell." source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">WikiPedia</a>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>
            Method name
        </h2>
        <p>
            The method name that shall identify this DID method is: <code>git</code>.

            A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
            <code>did:git</code>. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in
            lowercase.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>
            Method-specific identifier
        </h2>
        <p>
            the method-specific identifier for a DID is a unique Git repository URL or Git commit hash.

            The repository URL identifies a specific Git repository that can be cloned and manipulated using the Git protocol, 
            while the commit hash represents a specific commit in the Git repository. Both the repository URL and the commit hash 
            can be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the associated data, which is a key feature of the DID specification.
            The links to the formal rules describing valid GIT syntax will be added to the specification.

                Create
            </h3>
            <p>
                Creating a DID is done by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose a Git repository: First, you'll need to choose a Git repository that you want to use for your DID. This might be a repository that you control, or it might be a public repository that you want to reference in your DID.
                </li>
                <li>
                Create a Git commit: Next, you'll need to create a Git commit that contains the data you want to reference in your DID. This might be a JSON-LD file that describes your DID document, 
                or it might be some other kind of data that you want to associate with your DID.
                </li>
                <li>
                Push the commit to the repository: Once you've created the Git commit, 
                you'll need to push it to the Git repository. This will make the commit publicly available and 
                allow others to reference it in their DIDs.
                </li>
                <li>
                Create a DID document: Using the Git commit hash or repository URL, you can create a DID document 
                that references the data you want to associate with your DID. The DID document might include 
                additional information such as public keys, service endpoints, or other metadata.
                </li>
                <li>
                Publish the DID document: Finally, you'll need to publish the DID document to a 
                decentralized identifier registry or other relevant platform. This will make the DID publicly 
                available and allow others to resolve it and access the associated data.
                </li>
            </ol>

        </section>

            <h3>
                Update
            </h3>
            <p>
                The following steps MUST be executed to resolve a DID to a DID document using the
                <code>did:git</code> method.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    associated with your DID. This might involve updating the JSON-LD file that describes your DID document, 
                    adding new public keys or service endpoints, or making other modifications to the associated data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a new Git commit: Once you've made the changes to the data, you'll need to create a new Git commit 
                    that reflects those changes. This new commit will serve as the updated version of your DID.
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    Push the commit to the repository: Once you've created the new Git commit, you'll need to push it to 
                    the Git repository. This will make the updated data publicly available and allow others to reference 
                    the updated version of your DID.
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    Update the DID document: Using the new Git commit hash or repository URL, you can update the DID document 
                    to reference the updated version of the associated data. This might involve updating the updated property 
                    in the DID document, as well as any other relevant metadata.
                </li>
                <li>                    
                    Publish the updated DID document: Finally, you'll need to publish the updated DID document to the relevant 
                    platform or registry. This will make the updated DID publicly available and allow others to resolve it and 
                    access the latest version of the associated data.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Resolve the DID: First, you'll need to resolve the DID to obtain the Git commit hash or repository URL that is associated with the DID. 
                    This might involve querying a decentralized identifier registry or other relevant platform.
                    </li><li>
                    Clone the Git repository: Once you have the Git commit hash or repository URL, you'll need to clone the Git repository 
                    to your local machine or server. This will allow you to access the data that is associated with the DID.
                    </li><li>
                    Access the data: Once you have the Git repository, you can access the data that is associated with the DID. 
                    This might involve opening the JSON-LD file that describes the DID document, or accessing other files or data 
                    that are associated with the DID.
                    </li><li>
                    Verify the data: It's a good idea to verify the data that is associated with the DID to ensure that it 
                    hasn't been tampered with or modified. This might involve checking the digital signatures or other cryptographic proofs 
                    that are associated with the data.
                    </li><li>
                    Use the data: Finally, you can use the data that is associated with the DID for whatever purpose you intended. 
                    This might involve using the public keys in the DID document to authenticate the DID owner, 
                    or accessing other metadata or data that is associated with the DID.

            <ol>
                <li>
        Create a new Git repository: First, you'll need to create a new Git repository that will serve as the fork of the original DID repository. 
        This might involve using a Git hosting platform like GitHub or GitLab, or creating a new repository on a server or other platform.
    </li><li>
        Clone the original repository: Next, you'll need to clone the original DID repository to your local machine or server. 
        This will allow you to access the data that is associated with the original DID.
    </li><li>
        Create a new branch: Once you have the original DID repository, you'll need to create a new Git branch that will serve 
        as the basis for your fork. This might involve creating a new branch in the Git command line or using a Git client 
        or platform.
    </li><li>
        Push the new branch to the new repository: Using the new Git branch, you can push the relevant data to the 
        new Git repository that you created in step 1. This will create a copy of the original DID data in the new repository 
        and allow you to make changes and updates as needed.
    </li><li>
        Update the DID document: Using the new repository URL or Git commit hash, you can update the DID document to reference 
        the new forked repository. This might involve updating the id property in the DID document to reflect the 
        new repository URL, as well as updating any other relevant metadata.
    </li><li>
        Publish the updated DID document: Finally, you'll need to publish the updated DID document to the relevant platform 
        or registry. This will make the forked DID publicly available and allow others to resolve it and access the associated data.

                or a Git client. This will create a new Git commit that includes the changes to the DID.
            </li><li>

            </li><li>                   
                Submit a pull request: Using the hosting platform or other tools, you can then submit a pull request to the original repository that includes 
                the changes you made to the DID in the forked repository. This will allow the maintainers of the original DID to review the changes and merge them into the main branch of the repository if they are accepted.
            </li><li>                  
                Update the DID document: If the pull request is accepted and the changes are merged into the original repository, you'll need to update the id property 
                in the DID document to reflect the new changes. This might involve referencing the new commit hash or other metadata associated with the merged changes.
            </li><li>                
                Publish the updated DID document: Finally, you'll need to publish the updated DID document to the relevant platform or registry. 
                This will make the updated DID publicly available and allow others to resolve it and access the associated data.

            Relation to the did:web method
        </h3>
        <p>
            Similar to this specification, [[?DID-WEB]] also defines a new DID method based on domain names. The syntax
            of the identifiers is equivalent with the exceptions that 1. the method name in this specification is
            <code>git</code> instead of
            <code>web</code>, and 2. the <code>did:web</code> method also allows an optional colon-separated path
            component as part of its method-specific identifier, which is not supported by this specification. In terms
            of functionality, the main difference between the two methods is that while the <code>did:web</code>
            method requires both git and web infrastructure for its operation, the <code>did:git</code> method requires
            only git infrastructure.

        <p>
            The [[?DID-IN-git]] specification also provides a way to connect existing git infrastructure with DIDs. It
            uses similar Resource Records (RRs). It
            however does not define a new DID method specification; rather, it defines a way of discovering a DID
            (using any DID method) from a domain name, using the git infrastructure and protocol. This is intended for
            use cases where a domain name is used for bootstrapping initial relationships or interactions, but the
            domain name is not intended to be used beyond such an initial step.

            Similar to [[?DID-IN-git]], the [[?WELL-KNOWN-DID]] specification also does not define a new DID method and
            is rather used for discovery of a DID (using any DID method) via an existing domain name.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the discovery
            mechanism, it uses a <code>/.well-known/</code> path (see [[TBA]]) on a web server in addition to git.

        <p>
            git presents many of the attack vectors that enable active security and privacy
            attacks on the <code>did:git</code> method, and it's important that implementors address these
            concerns via proper configuration of git. For example, without proper security
            of the git resolution via <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484">git over HTTPS</a> it's possible for
            active attackers to intercept the result of the git resolution via a Man in the
            Middle attack which would point at a malicious server with the incorrect DID
            document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, implementors should be aware of issues presented by a Spoofed git
            records where the record returned by a malicious git Server is inauthentic and
            allows the record to be pointed at a malicious server which contains a different
            DID Document. To prevent this type of issue, usage of gitSEC which is defined in
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033">RFC4033</a>,
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4034">RFC4034</a>, and

            The DID operations defined in this specification do not provide an immutable history of changes that is
            typical for other forms of blockchain/DLT based DID methods, and which can be used for auditing purposes. This can lead
            to certain attacks where the DID document is manipulated temporarily, or different DID documents are
            presented to different resolvers, without an easy way to detect this behavior.

            The DID Working Group has extensively discussed the meaning of "decentralized" identifiers, and various
            aspects of this terms. GIT is considered to be a decentralized system, in a traditional sense.

        <p>
            Due to the nature of the <code>did:git</code> method relying upon a git in order to resolve
            the DID, all resolutions of a <code>did:git</code> identifier have the potential to be
            tracked by a git provider. To mitigate the
            issue of the relying party being tracked when resolving the DID document, the
            relying party should look to either use a trusted Universal Resolver service to
            gain herd privacy, utilize a VPN service or perform a resolution over the TOR
            network. Another emerging solution that will be useful to address this is <a
